Day 2: Finding a Gitcoin issue for you

By this point, you might have poked around the Gitcoin Issue Explorer to see the open source projects you could make money by contributing! If interested in doing work, here’s how.

Start Work
Click ‘Express Interest’ to provide a brief message to the repo-maintainer that you’re interested in the issue.

From here, you’ll receive an email and a notification when the issue is ready for you to work. You’ll be able to submit a PR directly onto the repo maintainer’s project from there. It’s that simple!

CTA: Check out the Issue Explorer if you haven’t already! If you don’t find good fits, let us know an open source project that you’d like to see using Gitcoin. No promises, but we might have something up our sleeve.
